#### Lunch picker

This is a web app that is designed to help aid us in selecting a venue for dev lunch.

It's probably going to be built using Babylon js and webGL.
Guess what, it was.

```
npm install
gulp serve
```

Hold space bar to launch disc.
You can change the launch angle by clicking and dragging on the screen.
The lunch venue will appear in the console.
It'll probably be pizza.

TODO:
1. Add graphics indicating type of food to each tile
2. Change launch angle to follow direction camera is pointing
3. Add overlay to indicate lunch venue choice.
4. Reduce pizza bias.
5. Add sliders for changing certain elements of the disc.. ie. bounciness, mass, friction.
6. Ability to change shape of disc.
